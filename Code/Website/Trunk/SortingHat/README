consider Individual crossover parameter - currently line number, could use percentage

 and list sorter - write the entire program to run as a servlet
print class list for lecturer backend
add lecturer field to classTimes.java DONE

fix for incorrect input or unmatched input of "className" in schedulingsystem
sanitise input
prevent duplicate student entry, check for legitimate student number and name
